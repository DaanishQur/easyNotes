# easyNotes
Transcribe speech and let AI organize your notes for you.
Using Google's and OpenAI's APIs I built a website where you can transcribe audio to text in which it will transcribe the speech as well as organize them, and then also allow you to download a .txt file so you can keep it.

(easyNotes is still technically in beta, meaning I will make changes to this overtime)
